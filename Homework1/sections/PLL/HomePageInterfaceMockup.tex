On the Homepage, the screen will show a menu on the left side that includes the app's logo, a button for accessing the user's profile, the library page, an explore page for discovering new songs and a logout button in case they want to leave the application. On the top row they will be able to see the app's name, a search bar for searching songs in the database and their profile photo on the top right corner to show that they are logged in.
Then, in the center of the page, the user will see two main rows showing our recommendations, picked by the algorithm: as of now the algorithm reads from the database songs and albums not older than 1 year, but this could be changed in the future.
