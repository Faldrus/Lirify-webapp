On the artist’s profile page, the menu on the left side and the top row will remain the same as in the user’s profile page. The center of the page will be divided in two parts, the artist’s information and options part and the account settings part. 

For the artist’s information part, the profile photo will be displayed in a bigger size along with the username and the mail. In addition, it includes the verify button, that will disappear once the account is verified; and the buttons for uploading either songs or albums and the biography area for the artist to describe himself.

For the account settings part, we maintained the same fields as in the user’s profile page, an option for updating the password and for deleting the account.
