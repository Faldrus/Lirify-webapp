For the song page, there will still be the top and side panels as in the other pages. In the center, the user will be able to see the name of the son, next to it a button to like the song, the YouTube video button, authorâ€™s name and a button for adding the song to a playlist. Below this, the lyrics of the song will be displayed, and on the bottom right corner the duration of the song will be shown.
