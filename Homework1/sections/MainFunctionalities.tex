Lyrify has two main users: users can sign up as an artist or as a normal user.

In order to access Lyrify, artists and users need to sign up providing their username for the app, an email and a password. In addition to this, artists need to select the artist check field before creating the account and later on they will have to ask for a verification in order to be able to upload songs or albums. 

As an artist, once verified, they are able to upload their own songs, providing the name, release date, genre, link to the lyrics and the link to the youtube video; create albums, providing also the name for it, the songs and the data required for them, a cover and a release date; and a small description talking about the type of music the do or biography. Albums once created cannot be changed. Artist are only able to upload data, not to consume it, for that they will need to create an user account. 

As an user, it is possible to choose the avatar you like for your profile, create playlists with your favorite songs, being able to add/remove songs whenever you want, add Albums to your library, look for suggestion on the main page and search for songs by name, genre or artists.
